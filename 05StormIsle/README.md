#H3
Tower Top

Hint: 
You can see the puzzle keys from the tower top if you watch closely down at the island. They are relativale small, so you have to watch carefully.

Solution:
WHALE-SNAKE-WHALE (from left to right). Stand next to the tower, pull the chain, and let the lift take you higher so you can reach the treasure box where the key is. 

#H3
Tomb High

Hint:
The pressure plates in front of the static puzzle keys move puzzle keys in the lower level. You can see these puzzle keys if you peek to the eastern end of the tomb through the shaft door.  
The static puzzle keys show the correct combination. 

#H3
Tomb Low

Hint:
Use shock magic to move the puzzle keys.
