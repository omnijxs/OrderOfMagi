Open thoughts:

* Write in-game book?
* Should “Arcane frenzy” be a thing?
* Spectre and Wraith effect level is now 25. Should it be higher? (30? 35?)
* Winter’s Widow is relative passive. Is it okay?
* Should Winter’s Grasp be a staff enchantment?
* Spectre and Wraith should not hunch near death
* Undead Conjures do not have any armor rating. 
* All Conjures do not use that many perks.
* Should Snowy Sabre Cat casting cost be higher?
* Should "Madness" be a thing (15 seconds of fear and 30 seconds of frenzy)
* Should "Fiend" be a thing?
* Dread’s reanimate occasionally misfires
* Dread spell visuals could be better
* Dread could have a sword/staff?
* Terror casting cost shows incorrectly per / sec
